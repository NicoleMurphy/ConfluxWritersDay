# Venue

The Conflux Writers' Day will be held at [University House] (http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse/), on the grounds of the Australian National University.

The plenary sessions, and some of the concurrent sessions will be held in the beautiful Great Hall - think of the hall at Hogwarts, although unfortunately without the floating candles.

The Conflux Writers' Day is NOT going to be helping with accommodation, but here are some nearby options:

[University House] (http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse/) - yes, the venue itself supplies accommodation and if you're prepared to share a bathroom, it's cheap. Share with a friend and it's even cheaper!

[Hotel Hotel] (http://www.hotel-hotel.com.au/) - Yes, that is the name. One of Canberra's newest hotels, it opens in November. It's promising to have a punky vibe to it. It's a ten minute walk from University House.

[The Diamont Hotel] (http://www.8hotels.com/canberra-hotel/diamant-hotel/) - Want to spoil yourself? The Diamant is next door to Hotel Hotel and is one of Canberra's more upmarket hotels.

[Rydges Lakeside] (http://www.rydges.com/Canberra) - 15 minutes walk from University House is Conflux conventions' original home by the lake.

[Novotel Canberra] (http://novotelcanberra.com.au/) - 20 minutes walk in another direction is the venue for Conflux 8, the Novotel, with some surprisingly spacious rooms.
