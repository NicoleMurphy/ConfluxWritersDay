<h1>Program</h1>

The Conflux Writers' Day will consist of four plenary presentations (each one touching on one of the four themes for the day) and a series of concurrent sessions.

Each presentation is an individual presentation - there are no panels.

Every presentation is about an aspect of writing and producing speculative fiction. It is not about discussing speculative fiction or other elements of fandom.
