Four plenary speakers will be addressing these themes. These speakers are:

There will also be 16-24 concurrent presentations bringing great thoughts and ideas to writers at all stages of their career.

The concurrent presentations will be chosen through blind review of abstracts submitted. See here for information on submitting an abstract. Abstract submission will open August 1, close October 31.
