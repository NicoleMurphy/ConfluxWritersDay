## Conflux Writer’s Day
**10am-5pm**

**Saturday April 5 2014**

The inaugural Conflux Writer’s Day will take place at [University House] (http://www.anu.edu.au/unihouse/), Australian National University, Canberra. For one day, Australia’s speculative fiction writers will gather for hours of professional development.

The theme of the day is ‘The Writer’s Journey’, which will be covered by four sub-themes – ‘Writing Skills’, ‘Writing Processes’, ‘Submission and Publication’ and ‘Building a Career’.

Four plenary speakers will be addressing these themes. These speakers are:

* Joanne Anderton
* Kaaron Warren
* Ian McHugh
* Keri Arthur

There will also be 16-24 concurrent presentations bringing great thoughts and ideas to writers at all stages of their career.

The concurrent presentations will be chosen through blind review of abstracts submitted. See here for information on submitting an abstract. Abstract submission will open August 1, close October 31.
