# FAQ

**Is this a science fiction convention?**

No. This is a one day writing-focussed conference. Everything will be about writing - the craft and the business of it. There will be no panels - each presentation will be given by one person on a topic that they have experience/knowledge of.

**Why is Conflux running it if it's not a science fiction convention?**

Conflux Incorporated has always had as part of its charter the support and development of writers. That's why the convention has so many writer-related activities. The Writers Day is a logical extension of that commitment.

**Why is it programmed as it is, with plenaries and concurrent sessions?**

The Conflux Writers Day is based on a fairly typical scientific/academic conference. There are a few Keynote Speakers, specially chosen for their skill and expertise, who speak to all the delegates. This ensures everyone gets an opportunity to experience some aspect of the themes of the conference (in this case Writing Skills, Writing Processes, Submitting and Publishing and Building a Career). Otherwise, delegates can choose which presentations they wish to see. This set up should enable delegates a wide range of experience and knowledge while also meaning they have the opportunity to focus on what they want to know at this stage of their career.

**Who are the Keynote Speakers?**

The Conflux Writers Day has four Keynote Speakers. They were each chosen for their particular topic because of the wealth of knowledge and experience they have in that area. The Keynotes are Joanne Anderton, Kaaron Warren, Ian McHugh and Keri Arthur. You can read more about them on the Keynote Speaker page.

**How do I get to be a presenter?**

You need to submit an abstract. Abstracts will be read by a chosen group of academics and writers to give the programmer feedback. The abstracts which best suit the themes of the day and match well with each other will be the ones chosen. For more information, see the Participate page.

**How can I access the member rate?**

To get the member rate to attend, you need to be a member of: [ACT Writer's Centre](a href=http://www.actwriters.org.au/), [CSFG](a href=http://csfg.wordpress.com/) (paid member, not just on the mailing list), [Conflux 9 or Conflux 10](a href=-http://www.conflux.org.au) (includes supporting memberships).

**It's more expensive than the usual day rate of a convention - why?**

The registration rate not only includes attendance and the con bag/handbook as per a usual convention, it also includes morning/afternoon tea and lunch. Plus there are smaller numbers here, so the cost can't be spread as thinly.

**I don't want to sign up until I know exactly what is being presented**

The full program will be announced in mid-December.

**What if I get a registration but then I can't attend?**

You can always swap your registration with someone. Sell it to them if you wish. Up to March 22, you can cancel and we will refund a percentage of the registration (we will keep $20 for administration costs). After March 22, there will be no refunds.

**Will there be a dealers room?**

No. But if you wish to advertise to this audience, there will be sponsorship opportunities, advertising in the handbook and inserts can be placed in the con bag. Email [confluxwritersday@gmail.com](mailto:confluxwritersday@gmail.com) for more details.

**Is there an anti-harrassment policy?**

Conflux Incorporated is currently revising the anti-harrassment policy and this will be available in the next few weeks.
