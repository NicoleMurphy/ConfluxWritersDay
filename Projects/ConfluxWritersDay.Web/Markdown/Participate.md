The Conflux Writers Day will be holding 4-6 concurrent sessions, and we’re looking for people to present these sessions.

The concurrent sessions will be made up of presentations of 20 minutes according to one of the four themes:
<ul>
  <li>Writing skills – the basics of writing eg punctuation, grammar, world building, characterisation, point of view…</li>
	<li>Writing processes – how you approach the writing eg planning, inspiration, environment, timetable.</li>
	<li>Submission and publication – how to submit, how to find publishers, how to manage your publications</li>
	<li>Building a career – decisions to be made, agents, publishers, marketing, business needs</li>
</ul>
We are looking for between 16 to 24 individual presentations.

Submissions will be made online. They will be reviewed – the reviewers won’t know who wrote a piece and authors won’t know who reviewed their piece but will receive feedback.

Passing review does not automatically mean inclusion in the Writer’s Day program – programmer Nicole Murphy will then decide the best presentations for the day.

All authors whose presentations are accepted for the program will receive free registration to the writers day (including the catering and the handbook/satchel).

You will be notified of acceptance or not mid-late November.
<h1> <b>The abstract</b></h1>
The abstract is a 300 word description of your presentation. It will be the vehicle by which the reviewers and the programmer choose whether to choose your presentation. You have a maximum of 25 minutes, so best to focus on explaining one idea well.

<h1><b>The presentation itself</b></h1>
The presentation should be accompanied on the day by a powerpoint presentation. The presentation should be Powerpoint 2003-2007 compatible. It needs to be ready and sent to the conference by March 22 2014. Details will be forwarded to you upon acceptance.
