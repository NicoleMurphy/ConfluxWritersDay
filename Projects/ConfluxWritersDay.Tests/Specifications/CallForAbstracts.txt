Story
As a potential submitter of an abstract
I want a clear explanation of what I need to do to be considered for the program
So I can submit my abstract in a correct and timely manner

Scenario: visiting the Call for Abstracts page
Given I am interested in submitting an abstract to be considered for the program
When I navigate to the page
Then I want to see a clear explanation of what is expected in the abstract
And I want to see themes that I can submit to
And I want a template to download to follow
And I want to know the conditions of submitting an abstract
And I want to know when I'll be told if I am successful or not
And I want to see the link so I can go to the abstract submission website
And I want a link to contact the convenor for more information
And I want a link to look at the program
And I want a link to look at the pricing/registration page
And I want a link to look at the overall information on the home page

Given I am interested in coming to the day but not participating
When I navigate to the page
Then I want to get an idea of the types of things that will be presented on the day
And I want to know the basic themes and ideas that could be covered
