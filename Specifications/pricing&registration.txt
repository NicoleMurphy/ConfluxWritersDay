Story

As a visitor
I want to see what the registration options are and what the prices are
So that I can I can decide if I want to register or not

Scenario - visit pricing & registration page
Given I am a visitor to the page
When I read the information on the page
Then I want the link to register online
And I want a link to download and post a paper registration
And I want the link to look at the program
And I want the link to how I can participate
And I want the link to venue information
And I want a link to contact the convenor for more information


Given I am choosing to register via paper
When I click on the link
Then I want a word document to download onto my computer
And I want the word document to be compatible with all forms of word processor
And I want the instructions on what to do and where to send it to be clear on the form
And I want multiple options for payment

Given I am chosing to register online
When I click on the link to begin my registration
Then I want the process to be quick and easy
And I want it clearly explained
And I want multiple options for payment
And I want an automatic email confirming that my registration has gone through

Given I am registering early
When I start the registration process, regardless of whether it's online or paper
Then I want a clear explanation of how I will be told whether I qualify for the earlybird or not
And I want a clear deadline as to when payment is expected
